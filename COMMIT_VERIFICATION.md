##  Commit Verification Policy

This repository now requires signed commits to prevent automated/bot commits:

-  All commits must be signed with GPG keys
-  Commit messages must follow conventional commit format
-  No automated commits without explicit approval
-  Regular security audits of commit history

*This notice was added as part of repository security enhancement.*
